## 📊 How It Works

Sombrero creates a visually stunning effect. The animated surface uses a damped cosine function based on distance to control the wave pattern. Here’s a simple breakdown:
- **Height Calculation**: The height of the mesh changes based on a cosine wave, which creates the ripple effect.
- **Wave Movement**: As time progresses, the wave moves, giving a sense of depth and animation.
- **Color Coding**: The color of the mesh changes based on its height, creating a gradient from blue (low) to red (high).

## 🌟 Features

- **Dynamic Visualization**: The animated surface reacts to time, providing a lively experience.
- **Graphical Customization**: Adjust parameters to create your own unique surfaces.
- **Interactive Control**: Easily exit the application whenever you like.
